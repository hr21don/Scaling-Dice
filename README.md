# Scaling-Dice
Your goal for this challenge is to write a Python function to determine the probability of different outcomes when rolling an arbitrary set of dice.

## Monte-Carlo Simulation Dices
MCS uses random sampling to evaluate possible outcomes.

* Your program should simulate rolling dice over and over to see how many times each outcome occurs and then determine the probabilities based on that.
* You'll need to simulate a really large number of rolls to get a result that's statistically significant. 

## Input
Variable Number of Arguments for sides of dice. 

## Output 
Table of probability for each possible outcome.
